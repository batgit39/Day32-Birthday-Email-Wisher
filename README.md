# Day32-Birthday-Email-Wisher
This is a automated birthday wisher made using smtplib, which uses 3 different templates and sends emails. You can add as many emails you like and change the templates.

To make this completely automated you have to add all the desired names,emails and birthdays in the birthdays.csv and add your details in main.py. Then one can use any service to host your python code like : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ and many others.
